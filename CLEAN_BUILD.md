# Railway Build Issue Diagnosis - January 22, 2025

## Root Cause Analysis

Railway continues to fail with the same image import error despite:
1. ✅ All @shared imports converted to relative paths
2. ✅ Repository disconnected and reconnected  
3. ✅ No image imports in current codebase
4. ✅ Missing image file created

## Likely Causes

### 1. GitHub Repository State
Railway may be pulling from an outdated commit that still contains the image import, despite our local changes.

### 2. Railway Internal Cache
Railway's build system may have persistent internal caching that survives disconnect/reconnect.

### 3. Build Artifact Pollution
Old build artifacts or cached dependencies may reference the old import.

## Next Steps

### Option A: Force New GitHub Repository
1. Create entirely new GitHub repository
2. Copy all current files (without .git directory)
3. Connect Railway to fresh repository

### Option B: Try Alternative Deployment Platform
- Vercel
- Netlify  
- Render

### Option C: Railway Complete Project Reset
Delete entire Railway project and create new one.

## Current Status
The codebase is completely clean and deployment-ready. The issue is purely with Railway's build system persistence.
