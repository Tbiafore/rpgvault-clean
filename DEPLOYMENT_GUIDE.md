# Railway Deployment Fix - Jan 22, 2025

## Final Fix Applied: Relative Import Strategy

Railway's build cache was extremely persistent and continued failing on @shared alias imports despite multiple configuration attempts. The solution was to revert all shared module imports to relative paths.

**Root Issue:** Railway production builds have unreliable support for TypeScript path aliases
**Solution:** Use relative imports (../../../shared/schema) throughout codebase for Railway compatibility

## Changes Made:
1. ✅ Reverted ALL @shared imports to relative paths: ../../../shared/schema and ../../../shared/categories
2. ✅ Updated all frontend components to use relative imports  
3. ✅ Updated all pages to use relative imports
4. ✅ Updated hooks to use relative imports
5. ✅ Missing image file created (Image_1753200339611.png)
6. ✅ Removed problematic image imports from homepage

Railway should now build successfully with stable relative import resolution.
